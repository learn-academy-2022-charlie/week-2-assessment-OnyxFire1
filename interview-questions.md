# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameters make methods more versatile, while an argument is a specific call to a function.

  Researched answer: Function parameters are the names listed in the fuctions definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initiated to the values of the arguments supplied.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map() can be used on an array of objects.

  Researched answer: The .map method calls a callback function on every elment of an array and returs an new array that contains the results. The .map method takes two arguments, of only one is required and creates a new array of all elements without changing the original array. The .map method is part of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used in the JavaScript languang to hold data and independently transmit them across a network. Everthing interacting with one another is Object Oriented perspective (language) which means they organize data in a way that helps people do all kinds of things.

  One interesting point is that OOP's replaced the "Do this/Do that" commands which was common with FORTRAN in the mid 1950's.


3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map returns pieces of informaiton, filter returns a subset of of information based on the criteria.
